# Setup modules

Will be taking the modular approach with the help of ```Nwidart Package```
following the steps in this doc: https://dev.to/codeanddeploy/how-to-implement-laravel-modules-structure-with-nwidart-package-1a5k

It is worth to be noted that creating new module is done by this command
```
php artisan module:make <module-name>
```
